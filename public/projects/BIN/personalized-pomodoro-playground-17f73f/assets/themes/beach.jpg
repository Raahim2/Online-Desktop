Okay, I need to clarify the request for `assets/themes/beach.jpg`.

`.jpg` files contain binary image data, not text-based code like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. I cannot generate the actual pixel data for a JPG image.

**Therefore, I cannot provide the content for `assets/themes/beach.jpg`.**

You will need to source an actual JPG image file (e.g., a royalty-free picture of a beach) and place it at this path within your project structure.
