Okay, I need to clarify the request for `assets/sounds/focus_music.mp3`.

`.mp3` files contain binary audio data, not text-based code like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. I cannot generate the actual sound data for an MP3 file.

**Therefore, I cannot provide the content for `assets/sounds/focus_music.mp3`.**

You will need to source an actual MP3 audio file (e.g., royalty-free focus music) and place it at this path within your project structure.
