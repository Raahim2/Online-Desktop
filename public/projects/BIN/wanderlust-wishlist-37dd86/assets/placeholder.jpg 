Generating the raw binary content for an image file like `assets/placeholder.jpg` is not possible in this text-based format.

**Action Required:**

You need to create this image file yourself. You can:

1.  **Create a simple image:** Use any image editor (like Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, or an online tool) to create a basic image (e.g., a solid grey rectangle, perhaps with text like "Placeholder"). A common size might be 600x400 pixels, but the exact dimensions depend on your design. Save it as `placeholder.jpg` in an `assets` folder within your project directory.
2.  **Download a placeholder image:** Search online for "royalty-free placeholder image" and download a suitable `.jpg` file. Rename it to `placeholder.jpg` and place it in the `assets` folder.

Ensure the `assets` folder exists at the root level of your 'Wanderlust Wishlist' project, alongside `index.html`, `css`, and `js`.
